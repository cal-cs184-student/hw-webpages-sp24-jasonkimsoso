	<div>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</div>
	<p>
		To rasterize my triangles I create a boundary box of the triangle from the 3 coordinates provided and loop through 
		each of the pixels to detect if they are inside the triangle or not by using the three line test. The winding of the triangle matters, 
		so to determine the CCW or CW direction I calculate the signed area of the triangle, where the positive area gives CCW and the negative area gives CW 
		(<a style="text-decoration:none"; href="https://cp-algorithms.com/geometry/oriented-triangle-area.html">link</a>). 
		This algorithm cannot be worse than the one that checks each sample that is within the bounding box because my algorithm gets the minimum and 
		maximum of the x and y points given and only loops through a smaller bounding box that contains the triangle instead of the whole box. 
		Below we can see that a naive implementation has some aliasing in the triangles from the zig-zag patterns on its edges.

	<div>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</div>
	<p> 
		Supersampling is useful because we can antialias an image and improve the resolution of our image. 
		To implement supersampling, I rasterized by triangles similar to Part 1, but now there are two extra for loops to 
		loop through each sub sample per pixel and test if each sub sample is inside the triangle. The size of the sample_buffer needs to be 
		\( \text{sample_rate} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \), which means the sample_buffer array size had to be changed dynamically 
		based on the sample rate. The way I store the colors of each sub-sample is in row major order but we jump/index into the array by the sample size and sample 
		offset to later average/downsample the sub sample's colors per pixel, which will be the final color of that pixel. For example, if the sample size is 4, 
		then index 0, 1, 2, 3 will contain the 4 sub samples for the beginning of the top row pixel and 20, 21, 22, 23 will contain the 4 sub samples for the starting 
		pixel of the second row and so on. For the images below, we can see how increasing the sampling rate reduces aliasing and softens those edges.

	<div>Task 4: Barycentric Coordinates</div>
	<p>
		To implement barycentric coordinates, I found that a matrix representation is much simpler 
		(<a style="text-decoration:none"; href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c2148h1044435_matrix_approach_to_barycentricareal_coordinates">link</a>). 
		Barycentric coordinates is a coordinate system consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma that are derived from three reference points. Basically it allows us to 
		define points relative to the reference points as proportions of an area (alpha, beta, and gamma). For example, in the triangle image below, we defined 3 
		reference points at the vertices that represent RGB colors; with barycentric coordinates we can interpolate colors at any point in the triangle.

	<div>Task 5: "Pixel Sampling" for Texture Mapping</div>
	<p>
		Pixel sampling, in our case, determines the color of the texel within a texture image by sampling screen pixels for a texel, which allows us to map 
		something from the screen space to the texture space. There are two different types of pixel sampling that were implemented: bilinear and nearest sampling. 
		Bilinear sampling involves grabbing 4 nearest samples that correspond to a point and performing 2 horizontal linear interpolations and 1 vertical interpolation 
		on those results; based on the distance of the point to the 4 different samples, we can obtain a pixel value for our texture map. To implement this, I found the 
		four nearest texels and LERP them as described above and returned the resulting interpolated value. For nearest sampling, we select the color of the nearest texel 
		of our texture coordinates. To do this, I rescaled the u, v texture coordinates to not be normalized and determined the nearest texel using the get_texel function. 
		Below we see 4 images that display nearest and bilinear sampling at different sampling rates. Improving the sampling rates improved the quality of both sampling 
		methods, but we can see that bilinear has an advantage because the texture of the Campanile is more defined compared to the nearest sampling as the colors "smoothes" 
		out more for bilinear. Hence the difference between the two methods becomes more apparent when the texture scaling is more defined, nearest might produce some 
		pixelation while bilinear can give a higher quality image than nearest.

	<div>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with Mipmaps for Texture Mapping </div>
	<p>
		Level sampling is when you sample different textures at levels of detail of an image based on the distance, where far away objects use higher levels to 
		prevent aliasing and closer objects in the image use lower levels to reduce blurring (mipmaps). For level 0, I simply assigned level to 0 to the sample 
		functions from Part 5, which means it is simply using the original texture level. For level nearest, I round the current level to the nearest level, and for 
		linear interpolation of level, I do a trilinear sampling grabbing two different levels and sampling them bilinearly and interpolating the results. For super sampling, 
		it requires more memory usage, and can reduce aliasing, but in turn it has a slower rendering speed since we now have to go through sub pixels. For point sampling, 
		there are two types: nearest and bilinear. Nearest sampling is faster and requires less memory usage compared to bilinear sampling; both methods though are not good 
		at antialiasing. For level 	sampling, it requires more memory as we are storing mipmaps levels and is a little slower as it requires some computation of levels, and 
		especially trilinear sampling. It is good at antialiasing as you increase the levels. Below we can see differences between the level and pixel sampling techniques. 
		Nearest level and linear sampling shows the best results as we can see the texture of the hair better, but there is some blur.
